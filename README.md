ðŸŽ“ Student Management System (CLI-based in Python with OOP)

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Design and implement a Command Line Interface (CLI) based Student Management System

using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The system should be able to:

ï‚· Manage student records

ï‚· Handle course enrollments

ï‚· Assign and track grades

ï‚· Save/load data to/from a file (JSON format)

Section A: Class Design and Implementation

Class 1: Person

ï‚· Attributes:

o name (str): Name of the person.

o age (int): Age of the person.

o address (str): Address of the person.

ï‚· Method:

o display_person_info(): Prints the personâ€™s details.

Class 2: Student (Inherits from Person)

ï‚· Additional Attributes:

o student_id (str): Unique identifier for each student.

o grades (dict): Subjects and respective grades (e.g., {"Math": "A"}).

o courses (list): List of enrolled courses.

ï‚· Methods:

o add_grade(subject, grade): Add or update the grade for a subject.

o enroll_course(course): Enroll in a specified course.

o display_student_info(): Print all student details.

Class 3: Course

ï‚· Attributes:

o course_name (str): Name of the course.

o course_code (str): Unique course code.

o instructor (str): Instructorâ€™s name.

o students (list): Enrolled student objects.

ï‚· Methods:

o add_student(student): Add a student to the course.

o display_course_info(): Print course details and enrolled students.

Section B: System Functionalities

Implement a menu-driven CLI interface with the following options:

1. Add New Student

ï‚· Input: Name, Age, Address, Student ID

ï‚· Action: Create and store new Student object

ï‚· Output:

Student Sami (ID: S001) added successfully.

2. Add New Course

ï‚· Input: Course Name, Course Code, Instructor

ï‚· Action: Create and store new Course object

ï‚· Output:

Course Physics (Code: PHY101) created with instructor Dr. ABC.

3. Enroll Student in Course

ï‚· Input: Student ID, Course Code

ï‚· Action: Enroll student if both exist

ï‚· Output:

Student Sami (ID: S001) enrolled in Physics (Code: PHY101).

4. Add Grade for Student

ï‚· Input: Student ID, Course Code, Grade

ï‚· Action: Assign/update grade (only if enrolled)

ï‚· Output:

Grade A added for Sami in Physics.

5. Display Student Details

ï‚· Input: Student ID

ï‚· Output:

Student Information:

Name: Sami

ID: S001

Age: 22

Address: Dhaka

Enrolled Courses: Physics

Grades: {'Physics': 'A'}

6. Display Course Details

ï‚· Input: Course Code

ï‚· Output:

Course Information:

Course Name: Physics

Code: PHY101

Instructor: Dr. ABC

Enrolled Students: Sami

7. Save Data to File

ï‚· Function: save_data()

ï‚· Action: Save students and courses to a file (JSON)

ï‚· Output:

All student and course data saved successfully.

 8. Load Data from File

ï‚· Function: load_data()

ï‚· Action: Restore data from file

ï‚· Output:

Data loaded successfully.

0. Exit

ï‚· Output:

Exiting Student Management System. Goodbye!

Section C: Error Handling & File Operations

Error Handling

ï‚· Validate student_id and course_code before any operation

ï‚· Ensure students are enrolled in a course before assigning grades

Bonus Challenge: File Operations

ï‚· Use json module for saving/loading data

ï‚· Must handle:

o Students and their attributes

o Courses and enrolled students

o Grades and enrollments
